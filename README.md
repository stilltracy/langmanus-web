> Come From Open Source, Back to Open Source

**The default Web UI for [LangManus](https://github.com/langmanus/langmanus).**

LangManus is a community-driven AI automation framework that builds upon the incredible work of the open source community. Our goal is to combine language models with specialized tools for tasks like web search, crawling, and Python code execution, while giving back to the community that made this possible.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [LangManus](https://github.com/langmanus/langmanus)
- Node.js (v22.14.0+)
- pnpm (v10.6.2+) as package manager

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: The URL of the LangManus API.

It's always a good idea to start with the given example file, and edit the `.env` file with your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Installation

**IMPORTANT: First, **start the Python server**, see [LangManus](https://github.com/langmanus/langmanus) for more details.**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/langmanus/langmanus-web.git
cd langmanus-web

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the project in development mode
pnpm dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Have fun!

## Docker

You can also run this project with Docker.

First, you need read the [configuration](#configuration) below. Make sure `.env` file is ready.

Second, to build a Docker image of your own web server:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=YOUR_LANGMANUS_API -t langmanus-web .
```

Final, start up a docker container running the web server:

```bash
# Replace langmanus-web-app with your preferred container name
docker run -d -t -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --name langmanus-web-app langmanus-web

# stop the server
docker stop langmanus-web-app
```

### Docker Compose

You can also setup this project with the docker compose:

```bash
# building docker image
docker compose build

# start the server
docker compose up
```
